        I wish I was hard but I am soft And things melt into me
        and I can’t help when things melt into me


        I feel weak though I am strong

        keep your silhouette.
        Robust
        corners are important to remember
        Keep the hard edge of my sillhouette, because losing that, blurring into curves and foggy moments, slow decisions - slow resolve, compromise as a chisel working against your grain, taking away from me so that i am less certain less sure of
        myself and who I have become. The slowness is not hesitation but a lack of conviction, not a stutter of insecurity but a close approximation of not remembering who I am, what is pure and unchangeable about my movements, my tone, my language,
        my
        touching, caressing, excitement,

        And a deep opposition to anyone telling me, convincing me in any way— as i interpret, a means to suggest i am less than, need guidance, don’t know what i want, who i am. that! there! that is was is soft about me, i am flat or resounding, I
        like
        to listen to people, I also don’t mind listening to people who need to or want to talk, to hear themselves talk included. but I like to talk as well, or maybe I like to learn and make things and those are louder than my voice, so true I don’t
        like to raise my voice, I don’t like to be the only one talking and also self-conscious about talking more than others. I don’t mean that to be understood as weakness, as uncertainty- there is no need to advise. I realize I do not want to
        apply
        for anything, I do not want to ask for acquisition. i do not care about money, do not care about repetition for repetition sake for doing something because it was said so, for doing something because money said so, i don’t want to. i wonder
        if
        I should have seen this coming, why is now the moment I am realizing things. ah, again a slowing, opening the window but leaving the screen, letting the fog assimilate to steam and feel as if I am myself but just different, misunderstood,
        adjacent to, but also friendly with. I don’t know if I want my voice to be louder, I am not sure if that is something that is important to me yet.

        I don’t want ur respect either, (to my parents) I understand that is something that does not come easy or earned. in this we do not align and I do not expect either of us to see each other, sympathetic at best, but not the same roots, the
        same
        soil, no hole to drain the excess, not quite as morbid as something rotting but …

        passive indeed
